"""This module is used for importing the KLayout Python API (pya).

Without this module, the API would need to be imported using ``import pya`` for usage in KLayout Editor and using
``import klayout.db`` for usage with standalone klayout package. To make it simple to create a python module for both
use cases, this module automatically imports the correct module and exposes it as ``pya``.

Usage:
    from kqcircuits.pya_resolver import pya
