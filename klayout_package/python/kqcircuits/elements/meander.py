    coordinates is given for ``start`` and ``end``, the GUI markers will not be shown. The latter is useful for
    code-generated cells that cannot be edited in the GUI.

    By default, the number of meanders is automatically chosen to minimize the area taken by bounding box of
    the meander. Uses the same bending radius as the underlying waveguide. Equidistant airbridges can be placed in the
    meander using ``n_bridges`` parameter.
