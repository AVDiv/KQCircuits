Pull Requests
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Push your branch back to GHE and make a pull request (PR). If you visit the
`repository home page <https://github.iqm.fi/iqm/KQCircuits>`__ soon after pushing to a branch,
GHE will automatically ask you if you want to make a PR and help you with it.

Select at least one person who you would like to have a look at your work.
Of course everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in the PR.

Once you have merged, delete your branch (local and remote) and
its corresponding issue to keep the repository clean.
