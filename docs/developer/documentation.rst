Documentation
-------------

All modules should be included in the KQCircuits api documentation.

The documentation is generated by the ``.rst`` files in ``docs\api`` folder.
If you create a new module you should make sure to include it here.

For each folder of code there should be a matching folder in the ``docs\api``
folder containing an ``index.rst`` file and a ``foo.rst`` file for each of
the ``foo.py`` files that are to be documented. For instance assume that you want
to document ``kqcircuits.elements.foo`` where ``elements`` is a folder containing
the ``foo.py`` file. Then the ``elements`` folder within the ``api``
folder should contain an ``index.rst`` file and a ``foo.rst`` file.

The ``index.rst`` file should then look like this::

    .. _elements :

    kqcircuits.elements
    ===================

    .. autosummary::

        kqcircuits.elements
        kqcircuits.elements.foo


    .. automodule:: kqcircuits.elements


    .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 4
       :hidden:

       foo

This ``rst`` files will generate a page with the title ``kqcircuits.elements``.

The ``autosummary`` section generates a linked
table with the entries given. The ``automodule``
section generates the documentation for ``elements`` taken from the ``toctree`` section
which includes the doc pages of the submodules that should be documented.

The submodule ``foo.py`` is documented in its own file (``foo.rst``) containing::

    kqcircuits.elements.foo
    -----------------------

    .. automodule:: kqcircuits.elements.foo
       :members:

This automatically generates a page with the documentation of the module ``foo.py``

Finally the ``index.rst`` file should be included in the toctree in ``docs/api/index.rst``
